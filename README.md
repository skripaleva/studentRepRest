## Welcome

Hi! This is my first todo-app on React.js!<br>
You can see the result [here]().<br>

The application contains information about me, my repositories and my contacts.<br>
In the Todo section, you can add a new case, edit and delete existing cases.<br>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to download a project:

Press the button 'Clone or download'.<br>
Choose a repository cloning method (Use SSH or Use HTTPS) and copy the link.<br>
Enter in the console: git clone repo_link<br>

### How to start

Go to the repository directory in the console and enter the command: npm start<br>

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
